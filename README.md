# Mpox Outbreak Analysis: Data-Driven Insights for Strategic Intervention

### 1. Introduction

Mpox has become a global health concern, and there is an urgent need to combat its outbreak, especially in underserved communities. The goal: to leverage data to highlight hidden risks of Mpox and propose practical, data-driven solutions for underserved communities. Over the past few weeks, we analyzed several records to uncover where interventions matter most and how data can save lives.

### 2. Problem Statement

Mpox continues to threaten underserved communities across Africa, where limited healthcare access, weak surveillance systems, and inequitable vaccine distribution make outbreaks deadlier. In many regions, cases go undetected until late, vaccines don’t reach the communities most in need, and community health workers are under-deployed. These structural gaps mean that even when global numbers show improvement, the most vulnerable populations remain at risk of preventable infections and deaths.

---

### 3. Objectives

Our analysis aims to address these critical gaps to improve outbreak response and slow the risk of wider spread. Our primary objective is to uncover key virus outbreak patterns and provide actionable recommendations for targeted medical interventions to combat Mpox, with a specific focus on underserved communities.

### 4. Methodology

We utilized an official Mpox dataset provided by Zion Tech Hub, which covers Mpox cases, surveillance, vaccination, and Community Health Worker (CHW) deployment between January 2024 and August 2025.

We leveraged **Excel** and **Power BI** for data cleaning, analysis, and interactive visualization. Our approach involved a range of techniques, including trend analysis, geographic hotspot mapping, case fatality rate review, vaccination gap assessment, and CHW deployment analysis. We designed a methodology that is replicable in low-resource settings, ensuring our insights are not just technical but practical for real-world application in underserved regions.

#### **1. The Looming Threat: Disease Burden & Trends**

* **Why you should care:** While overall Mpox cases have declined by over 70% from 2024 to 2025, this good news is a dangerous illusion. Our data shows that the Case Fatality Rate (CFR) has not improved, meaning the people who are getting sick are still dying at the same high rates. This suggests that the virus is not being managed effectively, and it is a symptom of a much deeper problem: cases are likely being detected too late, particularly in underserved communities where access to care is limited. This is a silent crisis where fewer cases can still lead to the same tragic outcomes.

* **What you can do about it:**
    * **Invest in early detection programs:** Deploy rapid diagnostic tests and mobile testing units to rural and remote areas to catch cases early before they become critical.
    * **Strengthen local health systems:** Provide funding and training to improve case management at the community level, ensuring that those who do get sick receive timely and effective treatment.

#### **2. Geographic Hotspots: Where the Battle is Being Lost**

* **Why you should care:** The fight against Mpox is not happening everywhere equally. Our analysis reveals that countries like **Burundi, Sierra Leone, and Uganda** carry the heaviest burden, with some of the highest case fatality rates in the world. This isn't just a matter of numbers; these are outbreak epicenters where communities are being hit the hardest. We also identified Mozambique as an emerging threat with a startling 55% year-over-year case increase, showing that a new crisis could be right around the corner if we don't act now.

* **What you can do about it:**
    * **Prioritize resources:** Direct medical resources, including personnel, treatment centers, and supplies, to these high-burden countries immediately.
    * **Proactive intervention:** Deploy rapid response teams to countries with emerging outbreaks like Mozambique to contain the spread before it escalates into a larger crisis.

#### **3. The Blind Spots: Surveillance & Testing Gaps**

* **Why you should care:** We cannot fight what we cannot see. A shocking **35,654 cases**—20% of the total—are classified as having an "Unknown Clade." This massive blind spot means we lack the crucial data needed to understand the virus and deploy tailored, effective interventions. Our analysis also shows that the countries with the highest fatality rates, like Burundi and Sierra Leone, have the lowest surveillance capacity. This disconnect between where the virus is most deadly and where our surveillance systems are weakest means we are flying blind in the regions that need us most.

* **What you can do about it:**
    * **Improve diagnostic capabilities:** Invest in rapid diagnostic tools and mobile testing units to reduce the number of unknown cases and provide health workers with the information they need to act quickly.
    * **Expand surveillance:** Scale up surveillance efforts in high-risk countries like Burundi and Sierra Leone by setting up more sites and training local personnel to track the virus more effectively.

#### **4. The Human Element: Community Health Worker (CHW) Shortages**

* **Why you should care:** We have the people, but we are not putting them where they are needed. Our data shows that while many Community Health Workers (CHWs) have been trained, one-quarter of them are not deployed in the field. This underutilization of a vital resource is undermining our entire response. In countries like Nigeria, the lack of CHWs is directly linked to low vaccine uptake and a weaker overall response. We are essentially leaving trained soldiers on the sidelines while the battle rages on.

* **What you can do about it:**
    * **Immediate deployment:** Deploy the idle 204,000 trained CHWs immediately to close workforce gaps across affected countries.
    * **Strategic placement:** Prioritize deploying CHW teams to outbreak hotspots like Burundi, Sierra Leone, and Uganda to boost on-the-ground efforts in case detection, vaccination, and health education.

#### **5. Vaccination Equity: A Tale of Two Realities**

* **Why you should care:** Vaccines are one of our most powerful tools, yet our data reveals a profound failure in getting them to the people who need them most. We found that nearly 183,000 doses have gone unused, a tragic waste of a life-saving resource. This is not just a logistical failure; it is a moral one. The countries with the highest disease burden—Burundi and Sierra Leone—have the lowest vaccination coverage. This gross inequity means that the very communities we are trying to protect are being left behind, prolonging the outbreak and increasing the risk for everyone.

* **What you can do about it:**
    * **Strengthen supply chains:** Improve transport and storage logistics to ensure vaccines do not get stuck before reaching health centers in remote areas.
    * **Increase vaccine accessibility:** Implement mobile vaccination teams to reach underserved communities and use simple tracking tools to ensure all delivered doses are administered.
    * **Monitor for gaps:** Continuously monitor vaccine administration rates at both the clade and country levels to identify and address any gaps in real time.

### 6. Conclusion

I strongly believe that data-driven insights can close healthcare gaps, accelerate outbreak response, and save lives. This analysis has pinpointed where the outbreak is hottest, where critical gaps persist (surveillance, labs, vaccines, workforce), and the urgent need to close them. We have seen that the fight against Mpox is not over, it has simply shifted. Without immediate and strategic action, the structural weaknesses we have identified will continue to amplify fatality risks, delay outbreak control, and threaten vulnerable populations. With attention paid to these critical areas, we can effectively curb Mpox transmission across regions and build a more resilient healthcare system for Africa and beyond.
